# A-Challenge
In this application you will be able to add, edit and delete items. Also the counter will update everytime you add or delete an item, and you can sort the items using drag and drop. The items you add will be saved in the localStorage.
# Instructions
To get started open the HTML file. You can start by adding an item with the button 'Add Item', this will create the item with an example image and text. To modify those you can click the 'Add Text' and 'Add Image'. Once you are done you can click on 'Submit Item' to finish. This will update the counter and localStorage.
If you want to change the image or text again you can do so by pressing the 'Edit Item' to enable the 'Add Text' and 'Add Image' buttons again.
However if you want to delete an item you can press 'Delete item'. This will update the counter and localStorage as well.
Finally, if you have two items or more, you can drag and drop them in the list, doing this will update the localStorage to keep the order of the items.
